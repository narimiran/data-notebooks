# Data science notebooks

Repository for my notebooks that deal with data exploration, data analysis, visualizations, machine learning, etc.

I'll try to populate it with the different notebooks I did over time.  
Most of stuff will probably come from kaggle.com datasets, but some things are my own explorations.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for viewing the notebooks.

List of notebooks:
* [Ex-Yugoslavian Countries - 25 Years Later](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/ex-yu.ipynb) - a look at the development statistics of ex-Yu countries in the last 25 years, after the Yugoslavian dissolution in '90s
* [Croatian elections 2016](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/hr-izbori-2016.ipynb) - (in Croatian) - comparison between several imaginary results of Croatian elections depending on different election rules used
* [My last.fm statistics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/lastfm.ipynb) - analysis of past four years of my music listening history
* New Coders - notebooks for [2016 New Coders Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-). Consists of two parts: 
    * [Part I: univariate analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/new_coders-part1.ipynb)
    * [Part II: multivariate analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/new_coders-part2.ipynb)
* Titanic - notebooks for [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Consists of three parts:
    * [Part I: exploratory analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/titanic-part1.ipynb)
    * [Part II: feature engineering](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/titanic-part2.ipynb)
    * Part III: machine learning - coming soon
