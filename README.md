# Data science notebooks

Repository for my notebooks that deal with data exploration, data analysis, machine learning etc.

I'll try to populate it with the different notebooks I did over time.  
Most of stuff will probably come from kaggle.com datasets, but some things are my own explorations.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for viewing the notebooks.

List of notebooks:
* [My last.fm statistics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/lastfm.ipynb) - analysis of past four years of my music listening history
* [Ex-Yugoslavian Countries - 25 Years Later](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/ex-yu.ipynb) - a look at the development statistics of ex-Yu countries in the last 25 years, after the Yugoslavian dissolution in '90s
