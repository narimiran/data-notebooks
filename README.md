# Data science notebooks

Repository for my notebooks that deal with data exploration, data analysis, visualizations, machine learning, etc.

I'll try to populate it with the different notebooks I did over time.  
Most of stuff will probably come from kaggle.com datasets, but some things are my own explorations.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for viewing the notebooks.

List of notebooks:
* [Ex-Yugoslavian Countries - 25 Years Later](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/ex-yu.ipynb) - a look at the development statistics of ex-Yu countries in the last 25 years, after the Yugoslavian dissolution in '90s
* [Croatian demographics 1991-2040](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/croatia-demographics.ipynb) - (in Croatian) - analysis of Croatian population through the years, and 2011 population census analyzed by counties. Also available as [medium.com article](https://medium.com/@narimiran/hrvatsko-stanovnistvo-jucer-danas-sutra-591629462fd8).
* [Croatian elections 2016](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/narimiran/data-notebooks/blob/master/hr-izbori-2016.ipynb) - (in Croatian) - comparison between several imaginary results of Croatian elections depending on different election rules used.
