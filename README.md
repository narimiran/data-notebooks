# Data science notebooks

Repository for my notebooks that deal with data exploration, data analysis, machine learning etc.

I'll try to populate it with the different notebooks I did over time.  
Most of stuff will probably come from kaggle.com datasets, but some things are my own explorations.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for viewing the notebooks.
